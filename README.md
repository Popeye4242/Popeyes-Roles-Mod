## Roles
### Detective
The Detective is a role for the crewmate team. The objective of the detective is to find bodies and gather information about the corpses. The detective can guard one person per entire game which renders the target immortal for the rest of the game. The target can still get voted of the ship.

### Engineer
The Engineer is a role for the crewmate team. The objective is to fix sabotages and observe the game by using the vents. If an engineer is in a vent he cannot be killed. The engineer can fix one sabotage per entire game. 

### Shape Shifter
The Shape Shifter is a role for the impostor team. The objective is to steal the shape of other players. The Shape Shifter cannot use vents.

### Jester
The Jester is a neutral role. The objective is to get voted out of the ship. The jester loses if he fails to get voted. 

### Hunter
The Hunter is a role for the crewmate team. The objective is to kill the Jester and the Impostors. If the Hunter kills a player that is not a Jester or an Impostor then both the victim and the Hunter die.

# Roadmap
This is the roadmap of features that will be worked on near future.
### Detective Role
Currently the role is just a copy of the Medic role from ExtraRoles. My goal for this role is to make it more focused towards analyzing dead bodies. But unlike Extra Roles I don't want to simply drop the name of the impostor in chat. The Detective should give hints that make it easier to solve kills.
### Engineer Role
The Engineer can sit in the vent without consequences. I want to change the play style of the engineer a little bit to make it easier for the impostors to kill the engineer. 
When tasks are done there is currently no reason for the engineer to leave the vent. Additionally I want to enable the Engineer to fix doors that he is close to. Fixed doors cannot bo sabotaged for a short time (similar to recently closed doors).
### Shape Shifter Role
The Shape Shifter code currently is mostly copied from The Other Roles. I plan to make the transitionioning of the morphing smoother instead of just being instantly there. 
### Hunter Role
There are currently no changes planned regarding the Hunter.
### Jester Role
In a meeting where three players are left the crewmates cannot win currently. I plan to change the jester to be able to win as crew if he wins with one other crewmate. If the impostors
### Additional Roles
Currently I do not plan to add additional roles to this mod. This mod is designed to have few roles to not be overly complex. If an additional role will be added then it should be a good role that improves gameplay as great as the classic roles. I am playing with the idea of adding a ghost role however.
### Skeld.Net
I plan to add Skeld.Net as Custom Server Option and make it the default. Currently you need to change the server region to skeld.net by yourself. 
### Game Modes
I currently do plan to add a game mode to this mod which makes the impostors anonymous. 
### Website
I am currently working on a website for this mod. The goal is to display information about this mod in a better way than it is currently possible with markdown only.
